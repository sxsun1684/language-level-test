{"id": 3, "content": "It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.\nThere are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .\nTo solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.\nIn conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself."}

{"id": 5, "content": "This essay topic was seen in a recent IELTS test in India\nOpinions are divided on the topic of who should bear the most responsibility for crimes committed by minors. There are those who believe that the parents of children who commit crimes should be punished, while others disagree. I believe that while both arguments offer valid points, the decision ultimately depends on the individual circumstances surrounding each crime.\nAccording to some people’s perspectives, all children regardless of their age should be held accountable for their actions, and that any punishment meted out to the child will serve as a deterrent to others. There is also the beneficial prospect of rehabilitation and instilling a sense of responsibility in the young offenders. Rehabilitation programs aimed at juvenile offenders can effectively reform their behaviour, thus making them responsible members of society.\nConversely, another perspective contends that parents should be held responsible, especially if negligence or poor upbringing has played a significant role in the child’s actions. The cornerstone of this argument is that parents play a vital foundational role in shaping a child’s moral compass. When parents neglect their duties or act as an inappropriate role model, they indirectly contribute to a child’s deviant behaviour. For instance, there have been a number of recent cases where children had unrestricted access to firearms at home and committed accidental crimes, which points directly to parental negligence.\nIn my opinion, a blanket approach cannot be applied in this complex matter. While children must learn about the consequences of their actions, it is also vital to assess parental roles in individual cases. A collaborative system which evaluates both the child’s understanding and parental neglect would be most appropriate and beneficial for everyone involved.\nThis essay is a great example of a Band 8 level. Overall, it demonstrates a strong command of language, effectively addresses the task, maintains coherence, and provides a thoughtful analysis of the topic."}
{"id": 6, "content": "This essay topic was seen in recent IELTS test in Italy .\nThe problem of reoffending following the release of criminals from correctional facilities is likely caused by insufficient rehabilitation programmes and the negative perception of ex-offenders in society. Improving jail rehabilitation programmes and lowering stigma through legal changes can be potentially effective solutions.\nAt the root of recidivism lies the lack of comprehensive rehabilitation in prisons. Many facilities emphasise punishment over rehabilitation, failing to address the primary causes that drive individuals to crime. For example, offenders with poor mental health or substance abuse problems often receive insufficient treatment, which leads to high reoffending rates upon release. Similarly, offenders who committed crimes out of desperation stemming from living in abject poverty are likely to turn to crime again in order to survive. Moreover, the stigma attached to having a criminal record complicates reintegration. It diminishes their chances of obtaining stable employment and social acceptance, thus pushing them back into criminal activities.\nEffective reduction of recidivism requires prisons to enhance rehabilitation programmes, incorporating mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and vocational training to improve employability. The duration of most sentences convicts are serving is of sufficient length to allow rectification of the issues that originally led them to crime, provided that prisons have expert-led and sufficiently funded programmes in place. Additionally, societal efforts to reduce the stigma associated with past criminals are crucial. This includes legal reforms to protect the rights of ex-offenders and public awareness campaigns to change societal perceptions. The success of countries like Sweden, with a focus on rehabilitation and low recidivism rates, demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.\nIn conclusion, tackling recidivism effectively necessitates a holistic approach that includes better rehabilitation within prisons and proactive societal measures to reduce stigma. This combination can significantly enhance public safety and reduce crime rates by facilitating the successful reintegration of ex-offenders.\nThis essay has all the prerequisites of Band 8 level writing."}

{"id": 10, "content": "There is no doubt that education and the process of learning has changed since the introduction of computers. The search for information has become easier and more entertaining, and connectivity has expedited the availability of data. Though systems have made computers more intelligent, they have not yet become a substitute for the human interaction in the learning process. In my opinion, what can be expected is a change in the teachers’ role, but not their disappearance from the classroom.\nNobody can argue with the fact that the acquisition of knowledge is more fun and easier with computers. The mere activity of touching and exploring this device constitutes an enjoyable task for a child. This, accompanied by a relaxing attitude and interactivity of software, usually contributes to a better grasping of new knowledge. At a higher educational level the availability of digital books, simulators and other academic materials provides the student with an ever accessible source of information, that otherwise would not be at hand.\nBut, besides the increasing complexity and behavior of intelligent software, which is usually embedded in the academic digital material, the need for human interaction in the learning process will always be present, at least in the foreseeable future. There is the necessity for a human being to be able to determine what the needs of each individual are. The expertise of a teacher in how to explain and adapt complex concepts to different individuals can hardly be mimicked by a computer, no matter how sophisticated its software is.\nAs computers are becoming a common tool for teaching, teachers should be more aware of their role as guides in the acquisition of knowledge rather than transmitters of facts. They have to be receptive to the changes that are taking , keep updated and serve as problem solvers in the learning process, thus allowing students to discover the for themselves.\nTo summarize, in my personal view, teachers play and will continue to play an important role in the classroom, especially at the primary school level. No matter how capable computers become, there will be no replacement for human interaction, but in the interaction takes place."}

Each and every one of us has to make financial decisions concerning recreation, health, education and more. The question is whether to start with financial education as part of school program or to postpone it for a later stage in life.\nTo begin with, being able to understand the value of money, the way the economic system works and to interpret financial news and its implications is a virtue. Without this virtue, an individual, even a young one, might suffer to some extent. For , a child who doesn’t understand the concept of money might find it more difficult to choosing only one present out of more possible ones."}
{"id": 13, "content": "Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.\nAdmittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.\nDespite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.\nOn top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way.  According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.\nIn the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students."}
{"id": 14, "content": "It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.\nFirstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.\nSecondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.\nThat being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .\nIn conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities."}
{"id": 15, "content": "It is often argued that educators have greater responsibility developing students’ cognitive and social aspects compared to parents. I absolutely agree with this notion, as teachers are well-trained to teach formal lessons. Aside from that, school is the best place for children to socialize and .\nIt is known for a fact that parents play a vital role in the upbringing of their . Nevertheless, educating them at home alone does not always mean leading them to a bright future. For this reason, it is extremely important that children be given a formal education. This is when school teachers come into play. Apart from providing a conducive learning environment, most schools constantly update their faculty with various contemporary methods of teaching through seminars and trainings. This approach has long been practiced in order to ensure students can cope with technological advancements. Furthermore, practical exercises and laboratory experiments significantly help increase their problem-solving, logical thinking, and reasoning abilities.\nWith regard to social aspect, it is also at school where youngsters learn to interact with peers. Apart from their daily classroom interactions, varied extracurricular activities are likewise offered to them, depending on their interests. These can be scouting, sporting events, and other , just to name a few. These opportunities basically enhance leadership skills, camaraderie, and teamwork, may not be acquired at home alone. It is, therefore, not surprising that majority of friendships emanate from schools.\nBy and large, I strongly believe that when it comes to honing the overall academic and social skills of the youth, mentors have a more crucial role than parents. It is because they are professionally trained in performing so."}
{"id": 16, "content": "This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).\nYou should spend about 40 minutes on this task\nGive reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.\nWrite at least 250 words\nMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of  money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.\nTo begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.\nAnother point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from  social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent  social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country."}
{"id": 17, "content": "It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.\nWhen it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.\nDespite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.\nIn conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar,  however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments."}

In my view, education should strike a balance between these two objectives, catering to the needs of society as well as the aspirations of the individual.\nThose who see education as a tool for societal utility argue that it should produce individuals who can contribute effectively to the economic and social fabric of their communities. This perspective emphasises the importance of equipping students with practical skills and knowledge that align with the demands of the job market. Such an approach is crucial for the economic development and stability of any society, because it ensures a workforce that is both skilled and employable.\nHowever, the importance of education to individual ambitions and personal growth is hard to dismiss. Advocates of this view argue that education should nurture creativity, critical thinking, and personal exploration, allowing individuals to realise their unique potential. This approach not only fosters self-actualisation but also encourages the development of innovators and original thinkers who can contribute uniquely to society.\nIn conclusion, education should ideally encompass both these perspectives. By providing a balanced curriculum that caters to the practical needs of society while also encouraging individual exploration and creativity, education can produce well-rounded individuals. Their capability of contributing effectively to their communities while pursuing personal fulfillment and growth will likely lead to a more dynamic and prosperous society.\nOverall, this essay is a strong Band 8.5 example."}
{"id": 21, "content": "This essay topic was seen in recent IELTS test in Oman .\nThe increasing use of computers and mobile phones among young people for communication has raised concerns regarding its impact on their reading and writing skills. While some people believe that this trend negatively affects literacy skills, I side with those who argue that it offers new avenues for language development.\nOne concern is that digital communication has introduced a simplified form of language that includes abbreviations, slang, and emojis, which may diverge from traditional language skills. As a result, young people often rely on this informal style of language even in formal settings. Additionally, the quick, bite-sized nature of digital content might negatively affect the attention span required for in-depth reading and understanding. This could potentially weaken this generation’s formal writing skills, which are crucial for academic and professional success.\nHowever, these drawbacks are balanced by significant benefits. The digital era has led to an increase in the quantity and diversity of reading and writing. Young individuals come across various forms of text online, which exposes them to different language styles and vocabulary. The interactive nature of digital platforms also encourages active engagement with text, fostering improved language skills. Moreover, digital communication equips young people with a different set of language skills, such as being able to effectively and concisely convey information. They are also better able to read between the lines to decipher the deeper meanings of a text conversation.\nIn conclusion, while the informal nature of digital communication poses challenges to traditional reading and writing skills, it also offers opportunities for developing a broader set of literacy skills. I believe that the negative influence of digital devices on young users’ language skills is insignificant compared to the benefits they bring.\nOverall, this essay would get an IELTS Band 8 for the reasons outlined below."}
